# digit recognition in matlab

To use this program run the mpaper.m file. Then a window with squares will appear, you are supposed to draw as many numbers as you want but, only one number in each square. 

When you finish drawing the numbers press the middle button of your mouse or use the Shift+left button combination. That will create a popup with 4 options to choose the architecture you prefer for your classifier:

->Filter + One Layer
->One Layer Classifier
->Two Layer Classifier
->Best


Each option will give you the best classifier for that architecture. Choosing the option "Best" will give you the best two classifiers output, regardless of architecture.s
