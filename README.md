# digit recognition in matlab

To use this program run the mpaper.m file. Then a window with squares will appear, you are supposed to draw as many numbers as you want but, only one number in each square. 

When you finish drawing the numbers press the middle button of your mouse or use the Shift+left button combination. That will create a popup with 4 options to choose the architecture you prefer for your classifier:

->Filter + One Layer
->One Layer Classifier
->Two Layer Classifier
->Best
->Second Best


Each option will give you the best classifier for that architecture. Choosing the option "Best" or "Second Best" will give you the best or second best classifier output, regardless of architecture. If you want to try other classifiers on the same drawn set just press the button for classify again on mpaper.
